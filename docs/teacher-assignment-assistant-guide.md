The assistant responds to natural language. Here are some effective ways to begin:

**Direct Requests**:
- "I need a restaurant conversation for A1 students"
- "Create a debate about climate change for B2 level"
- "Help me make a pronunciation exercise for German food words"

**General Inquiries**:
- "What's the best assignment type for practicing past tense?"
- "I have A2 students who need speaking practice"
- "My students struggle with formal writing"

**Exploration**:
- "What assignment types do you support?"
- "Show me examples of debate topics"
- "How do audio dialogue assignments work?"

### Conversation Flow

1. **Initial Request**: Describe what you want
2. **Clarification**: AI asks for required details
3. **Enhancement**: AI suggests useful optional parameters
4. **Generation**: Assignment is created with full instructions
5. **Review**: Results are presented with all details
6. **Iteration**: Make modifications or create additional assignments

### Example Conversations

#### Creating a Chatbot Assignment

**You**: "I need something for my A1 students to practice ordering food"

**AI**: "Perfect! A chatbot assignment would be ideal for restaurant ordering practice. This lets students have realistic conversations with an AI waiter.

I'll need a few details:
- What specific language skills should they practice? (e.g., polite expressions, food vocabulary, asking questions)
- What should students accomplish in the conversation? (e.g., order a meal, ask about ingredients, request the bill)

Would you like this to be a general restaurant scenario, or do you have a specific type of restaurant in mind?"

**You**: "They should practice polite expressions and basic food vocabulary. The goal is to successfully order a meal and ask about ingredients."

**AI**: "Excellent! I'll create a chatbot assignment where students practice polite restaurant ordering with an AI waiter. A few more details to make this perfect:

- Should this be a casual caf√©, formal restaurant, or fast food setting?
- How many conversation exchanges would be appropriate? (8-12 is typical for A1)
- Would you like me to save this assignment for future use?

I can also add a character role for the AI - perhaps a friendly, patient waiter who helps beginners?"

#### Creating an Audio Dialogue

**You**: "Create an audio dialogue about planning a weekend trip to Berlin for A2 students"

**AI**: "Great choice! Audio dialogues give students natural conversation examples. For your Berlin trip planning:

I need to set up the speakers. How about:
- 2-3 friends discussing the trip?
- What personalities should they have? (enthusiastic planner, budget-conscious, foodie, etc.)
- Should they focus on activities, accommodation, transportation, or all aspects?
- How long should the conversation be? (2-4 minutes works well for A2)

I can generate the actual audio file with different voices for each speaker!"

### Tips for Best Results

#### Be Specific About Learning Goals
Instead of: "Create a speaking assignment"
Try: "Create a presentation assignment where B1 students practice describing their hometown for 3-4 minutes"

#### Mention Your Students' Needs
- "My students struggle with pronunciation of German umlauts"
- "They need practice with past tense in conversational contexts"
- "I want them to work on formal register for business situations"

#### Provide Context
- "This is for homework, so it should be self-guided"
- "We're studying Unit 5 about family relationships"
- "They'll do this in pairs during class time"

#### Ask for Variations
- "Can you make a harder version for advanced students?"
- "Create three different topics on the same theme"
- "Make this more interactive"
